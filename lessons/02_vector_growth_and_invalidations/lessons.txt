Lesson 2: Vector growth and invalidation
Goal
 - Understand size vs capacity
 - Observe growth (reallocations) and element moves
 - Know exact invalidation rules (and how to avoid surprises)
 - Practice reserve, resize, shrink_to_fit, push_back vs emplace_back

 Step 1: Instrumented capacity logger (precise growth pattern)
